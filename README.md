# Patient Encounter Cost & Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems

## Executive Summary:
Healthcare organizations face growing challenges in managing rising costs, payer coverage gaps, and operational inefficiencies. To address this, I leveraged SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization to examine patient encounters, procedure costs, and payer performance. The project identified 159 high-cost patients, 41 long-duration encounters, and major coverage gaps in high-value procedures like Electrical Cardioversion.
Next steps include automating dashboards for real-time insights and integrating predictive models to anticipate high-cost patients.
This project can help healthcare organizations achieve measurable improvements by :
1) Improving revenue performance by 10â€“15% through better payer negotiations and optimized claim management.
2) Reducing uncovered costs by up to 20% by identifying high-cost encounters and addressing coverage gaps.
3) Enhancing care efficiency through data-driven insights that streamline resource utilization and patient management.

## Business problem: 

Healthcare organizations face mounting pressure to manage Operational Costs and Mitigate Financial Risks in patient care. Rising healthcare expenditures, high-cost patient encounters, and coverage gaps across payer types (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance) threaten both financial stability and efficient resource allocation.

## Methodology: 

1) Data Extraction and Preparation:Collected and integrated datasets from Encounters, Patients, Procedures, Payers, and Organizations using SQL, ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and readiness for analysis.
2) Data Analysis: Utilized SQL queries to identify high-cost encounters, payer coverage gaps, and encounter duration patterns, uncovering key financial and operational risks.
3) Visualization and Insight Generation: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards, visualize cost trends, and generate actionable insights for enhancing revenue performance and care efficiency.

## Skills:

SQL (Structured Query Language): For data extraction, transformation, and analytical querying across multiple healthcare datasets.

Power BI: For building interactive dashboards, visualizing cost trends, and presenting key financial and operational insights.

Data Analysis & Interpretation: For identifying high-cost patterns, payer coverage gaps, and risk factors to support data-driven decision-making.
