# Patient Encounter Cost & Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems

## Executive Summary:
Healthcare organizations face growing challenges in **managing rising costs, payer coverage gaps, and operational inefficiencies**. To address this, I leveraged SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization to examine patient encounters, procedure costs, and payer performance. The project identified 159 high-cost patients, 41 long-duration encounters, and major coverage gaps in high-value procedures like Electrical Cardioversion.
Next steps include automating dashboards for real-time insights and integrating predictive models to anticipate high-cost patients.
This project can help healthcare organizations achieve measurable improvements by :
1) Improving revenue performance by **10–15%** through better payer negotiations and optimized claim management.
2) Reducing uncovered costs by up to 20% by identifying high-cost encounters and addressing coverage gaps.
3) Enhancing care efficiency through data-driven insights that streamline resource utilization and patient management.

## Business problem: 

Healthcare organizations face mounting pressure to manage Operational Costs and Mitigate Financial Risks in patient care. Rising healthcare expenditures, high-cost patient encounters, and coverage gaps across payer types (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance) threaten both financial stability and efficient resource allocation.

## Methodology: 

1) Data Extraction and Preparation:Collected and integrated datasets from Encounters, Patients, Procedures, Payers, and Organizations using SQL, ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and readiness for analysis.
2) Data Analysis: Utilized SQL queries to identify high-cost encounters, payer coverage gaps, and encounter duration patterns, uncovering key financial and operational risks.
3) Visualization and Insight Generation: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards, visualize cost trends, and generate actionable insights for enhancing revenue performance and care efficiency.

## Skills:

SQL (Structured Query Language): For data extraction, transformation, and analytical querying across multiple healthcare datasets.

Power BI: For building interactive dashboards, visualizing cost trends, and presenting key financial and operational insights.

Data Analysis & Interpretation: For identifying high-cost patterns, payer coverage gaps, and risk factors to support data-driven decision-making.

## Result and Business Recommendations:

The findings highlight that certain population segments experience higher encounter rates and cost burdens, signaling opportunities for targeted care strategies and resource optimization.
Implement focused health programs for high-risk demographics (e.g., chronic heart care for elderly males, prenatal wellness for women).
Launch preventive screening and awareness campaigns for Hyperlipidemia and Heart Failure to reduce long-term treatment costs.
Reallocate clinical resources toward conditions with both high frequency and high uncovered costs to maximize healthcare ROI.
Strengthen partnerships with payers to enhance coverage for underfunded yet high-volume conditions, improving affordability and patient outcomes.

## Next Steps:

To derive a more holistic understanding of patient risk and financial exposure, the following next steps are recommended:

- Integrate Additional Data Sources:Combine clinical, billing, and pharmacy datasets to uncover links between medical history, medication adherence, and cost outcomes.

- Perform Predictive Modeling:Build machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or random forest) to predict high-cost encounters or at-risk patients based on demographics and diagnosis patterns.

- Enhance Data Granularity:Incorporate visit-level and time-series data to analyze patient progression, recurrence patterns, and treatment effectiveness over time.

- Develop Interactive Dashboards:Use Power BI or Tableau to visualize cost hotspots, encounter frequencies, and demographic disparities in real time for stakeholders.

- Implement Risk Scoring Framework:Assign each patient a risk index combining cost, frequency, and condition severity — to support proactive interventions and payer negotiations.

- Conduct Deeper Root Cause Analysis:Explore why certain demographics or diagnosis codes show higher costs — e.g., delayed care, limited insurance, or chronic management gaps.

- Collaborate with Clinical & Financial Teams:Validate findings with doctors, case managers, and finance teams to translate insights into practical healthcare and operational actions.
